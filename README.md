# Summary of Retrofy's technical workings

At its core Retroy is an amalgamation of multiple different emulator engines, which emulate different home video game consoles depending on the input source (i.e game) that is being played. Retrofy itself only ever unites all of these different emulators into one singular interface for ease of use so that the user can access any game at any time without having to swap between applications.


# Supported video game consoles

At launch Retrofy will focus on the following systems first:
1. Nintendo GameCube
2. Nintendo Wii
3. Nintendo 3ds


After a long initial trial and error / test phase Retrofy will add the following additional systems:
1. Playstation 1-3
2. Sega Saturn
3. GBA/GBC
4. N64
5. NES
6. SNES
7. Nintendo DS
8. Atari

Eventually Retrofy should be able to run most older systems.
